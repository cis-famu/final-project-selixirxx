        <div class="ptext imgmargin">For the assignment where we had to do sketches and line art, we used a new app that I wasn't familiar with. It didn't have any of the features I was used to in the app I usually use so it was interesting to try something new as it made me more thoughtful on where to put my lines. It was also nice not having to draw something perfect and the assignment allowed for showing just your creativity rather than worrying about shaky lines. What I took from this class is not to worry about trying something and not being good at it.</div>
